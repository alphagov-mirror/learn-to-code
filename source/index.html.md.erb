# Learn to Code

The Government Digital Service is a diverse organisation, with lots of people
with lots of different skills. Some people who work at GDS are professional
software engineers, but many others have never written any code.

This documentation contains tutorials that are intended to take an absolute
beginner through the basics of writing code.
